# DAI Reimplementation

## Overview

This project is a reimplementation of the DAI stablecoin smart contract, upgraded to Solidity 0.8.x. The primary goal is to improve code readability and maintainability, with a focus on better variable naming conventions.

## Progress

- [X] dai.sol => DaiERC20.sol
- [X] vat.sol =>[comment]
- [X] spot.sol =>[comment]
- [X] join.sol =>[comment]
- [ ] abaci.sol
- [ ] dog.sol
- [ ] clip.sol

## Motivation

The main reasons for this reimplementation are:

1. Unusual and confusing variable naming in the original DAI implementation
2. Upgrade to Solidity 0.8.x to leverage newer language features and optimizations
3. Improve overall code readability and maintainability

By addressing these issues, we aim to create a more understandable and maintainable version of the DAI contract.

## Features

- Upgraded to Solidity 0.8.x
- Improved variable naming conventions
- Enhanced code readability and structure
- Leveraging Solidity 0.8.x built-in safeguards
